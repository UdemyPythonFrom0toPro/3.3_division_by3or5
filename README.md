# You get a number input from the user.

Construct a loop from 0 to the entered number (inclusive) and calculate the sum of all numbers that are divisible by 3 or 5 without a remainder. Print this number to the console.

Note: the problem is solved both by direct for and by using a list comprehension
(you can sum the numbers of the "filtered" list by passing the list to the sum (arg_list) function).
